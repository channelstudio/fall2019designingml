# Assignments

For all readings unless otherwise noted, please write down two non "yes or no" questions and type them into the Google doc I've shared with you. Be prepared to discuss the questions/readings in class.

## Week 6 (due 10/11)

* Read

  * [A New Approach to Understanding How Machines Think](https://www.quantamagazine.org/been-kim-is-building-a-translator-for-artificial-intelligence-20190110/) - TCAV concept is less important than surrounding context
  * [Dimensionality-Reduction Algorithms
for Progressive Visual Analytics](https://www.asci.tudelft.nl/media/thesis/405_nicola_pezzotti.pdf) - just summary and introduction

* Code
  * Try using our multilayer perceptron with a different dataset. Can you get it to work with CIFAR-10 or Fashion MNIST datasets? What about the Iris dataset? Try playing with hyperparameters and number of layers/connections. I highly recommend reviewing the referenced material in the class notes if you are at all confused.

## Week 5 (due 10/3)

* Read
  * [Excavating AI](https://www.excavating.ai/)

* Code
  * Continue trying to scrape websites using what we covered in class.

## Week 4 (due 9/27)

* Read
  * [Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/)
  * [Creative AI](https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3) - optional reading, will discuss in class

* Code
  * Review the notes from class and be sure you understand the concept of the perceptron
  * Watch videos/read articles if unclear
  * Try implementing the perceptron on another dataset

## Week 3 (due 9/20)

* Read
  * [Anatomy of an AI System](https://anatomyof.ai/)
  * [Power, Pollution and the Internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html)
  * [Creating an AI can be five times worse for the planet than a car](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205779-creating-an-ai-can-be-five-times-worse-for-the-planet-than-a-car/)

* Watch (optional)
  * [Vectors, what even are they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs)
  * [Vectors - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJkvxQXIa8)
  * [Vector Math - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b1_3bNCxk)
  * [Vector Math II - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHusbFmq-4I)

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * Try implementing your own classifier using one of the other [Scikit learn toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets). Google around for ideas. This will not be graded or collected.

## Week 2 (due 9/13)
* Read
  * [The Myth of AI by Jaron Lanier](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-the-myth-of-ai) (just read article not comments or video)
  * [More States Opting To ‘Robo-Grade’ Student Essays By Computer](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/30/624373367/more-states-opting-to-robo-grade-student-essays-by-computer)
  * [Don’t Call AI “Magic” by M.C. Elish](https://points.datasociety.net/dont-call-ai-magic-142da16db408)

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * If you are having a hard time with Python, try doing all the "Learn the Basics" section at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/)
  * I recommend also picking up Learn Python 3 the Hard Way if you like learning from printed books

## Week 1 (due 9/6)
* Read
  * [Artificial Intelligence Hits the Barrier of Meaning by Melanie Mitchell](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/opinion/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.html)
  * [Ways to think about machine learning by Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy)
  * [Towards a Poetics of Artificial Superintelligence by Nora N. Khan](https://medium.com/after-us/towards-a-poetics-of-artificial-superintelligence-ebff11d2d249)
