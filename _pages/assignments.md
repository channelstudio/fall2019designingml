# Assignments

For all readings unless otherwise noted, please write down two non "yes or no" questions and type them into the Google doc I've shared with you. Be prepared to discuss the questions/readings in class.

## Week 10 (due 11/8)

* Read
  * [Physiognomys New Clothes](https://medium.com/@blaisea/physiognomys-new-clothes-f2d4b59fdd6a)

## Week 7

The Midterm (due 10/25)

Choose an image data set to explore. This can be an existing API or data set such as a digital museum collection, but it could also be a data set of your own creation such as a website that you scrape or collection of your own photos. Using the tools we covered in the last class, create an analysis of the visual topology of this collection. When using machine learning to look with a macro lens, what patterns emerge? What narratives are newly exposed with these techniques?

Be sure to collect at least 500-600 images in order to have enough to analyze. The final deliverable for this class will be a series of images, along with a quick in-class presentation. If you are comfortable with web development, please feel free to create something larger for the midterm.

Presenting the project: 

If there are no group projects then we will have less than 10 minutes per person to present, "pecha kucha" style. I will be expecting a fairly concrete and succinct presentation of about 5 minutes.

Metrics for grading:
* 25% - Originality of concept - Does the project explore an original and novel concept?
* 25% - Fit and finish - Is the project finished? Was there clearly thought put into this?
* 25% - Theme - Did the project follow the prompt?
* 25% - Presentation - Is the presentation coherent and thoughtful?

Due 10/18:

Before class, email me:

* One paragraph describing what your project explore
* If applicable, a link to the data set you will be using
* The name of the data set you will be using

## Week 6 (due 10/11)

* Read

  * [A New Approach to Understanding How Machines Think](https://www.quantamagazine.org/been-kim-is-building-a-translator-for-artificial-intelligence-20190110/) - TCAV concept is less important than surrounding context
  * [Dimensionality-Reduction Algorithms
for Progressive Visual Analytics](https://www.asci.tudelft.nl/media/thesis/405_nicola_pezzotti.pdf) - just summary and introduction

* Code
  * Try using our multilayer perceptron with a different dataset. Can you get it to work with CIFAR-10 or Fashion MNIST datasets? What about the Iris dataset? Try playing with hyperparameters and number of layers/connections. I highly recommend reviewing the referenced material in the class notes if you are at all confused.

## Week 5 (due 10/3)

* Read
  * [Excavating AI](https://www.excavating.ai/)

* Code
  * Continue trying to scrape websites using what we covered in class.

## Week 4 (due 9/27)

* Read
  * [Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/)
  * [Creative AI](https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3) - optional reading, will discuss in class

* Code
  * Review the notes from class and be sure you understand the concept of the perceptron
  * Watch videos/read articles if unclear
  * Try implementing the perceptron on another dataset

## Week 3 (due 9/20)

* Read
  * [Anatomy of an AI System](https://anatomyof.ai/)
  * [Power, Pollution and the Internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html)
  * [Creating an AI can be five times worse for the planet than a car](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205779-creating-an-ai-can-be-five-times-worse-for-the-planet-than-a-car/)

* Watch (optional)
  * [Vectors, what even are they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs)
  * [Vectors - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJkvxQXIa8)
  * [Vector Math - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b1_3bNCxk)
  * [Vector Math II - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHusbFmq-4I)

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * Try implementing your own classifier using one of the other [Scikit learn toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets). Google around for ideas. This will not be graded or collected.

## Week 2 (due 9/13)
* Read
  * [The Myth of AI by Jaron Lanier](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-the-myth-of-ai) (just read article not comments or video)
  * [More States Opting To ‘Robo-Grade’ Student Essays By Computer](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/30/624373367/more-states-opting-to-robo-grade-student-essays-by-computer)
  * [Don’t Call AI “Magic” by M.C. Elish](https://points.datasociety.net/dont-call-ai-magic-142da16db408)

* Code
  * Review the in class jupyter notebook
  * If you are having a hard time with Python, try doing all the "Learn the Basics" section at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/)
  * I recommend also picking up Learn Python 3 the Hard Way if you like learning from printed books

## Week 1 (due 9/6)
* Read
  * [Artificial Intelligence Hits the Barrier of Meaning by Melanie Mitchell](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/opinion/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.html)
  * [Ways to think about machine learning by Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy)
